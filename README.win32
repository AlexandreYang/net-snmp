The win32 directory contains a Microsoft VC++ (5.0,6.0) workspace and
project files to build both static and DLL versions of the UCD SNMP
library as well as most of the applications (snmpd and snmptrapd not
included). 

A manually generated config.h file has been provided for use with the
win32 build since the basic win32 environment does not support autoconf.
Note: the compiled in MIB path is \usr\mibs which may be changed by
editting win32/config.h

To build the libraries and applications, open the wokspace in VC++ and
simply run 'Build' from the menu. The applications and DLL will be
output to win32/bin and the lib files will be output to win32/lib.

Not sure how the above could be done using just 'nmake' from the DOS
shell but it should be feasible.

Also note: An alternate way to build UCD SNMP for win32 is to use
Cygnus's cygwin32 environment.  Make sure to get the 'full' version.
The 'user' version does not contain the programs necessary to run
the GNU configure mechanism, which is used to by UCD SNMP.  Information
on the Cygnus cygwin32 environment is available on the web at :
http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/.
