The attached "build" script does a "one-shot" build 
 and packaging of an untarred net-snmp distribution 
 on Solaris without requiring root access. 
 
 The resulting native Solaris package can then be 
 (automatically) installed/removed using the Solaris 
 pkgadd(1)/pkgrm(1) commands. 
 
 The script requires customization of your 
 development environment - see attached file 
 DEVENV - before it can be used. 
 
 Basic usage: ./net-snmp-x.y-build distclean 
 
 The attached script "elfdepend" is required to 
 determine the dependencies of all built ELF binaries 
 and libraries to create a "package dependency file" - 
 see depend(4). 
 
 Has been tested on Solaris 2.7 and 2.9 with net- 
 snmp-5.0.6. 
 Earlier versions of net-snmp (4.x to 5.0.x) were 
 packaged with earlier versions of this script and will 
 most probably also work. 
 
 The patches included with the build script will 
 mostly be obsolete in 5.0.7 (see included bug 
 tracker reference)
