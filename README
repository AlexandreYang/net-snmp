INTRODUCTION

  This package was originally based on the CMU 2.1.2.1 snmp code.  It
  has been greatly modified, restructured, enhanced and fixed.  It
  hardly looks the same as anything that CMU has ever released.  It
  was renamed from ucd-snmp to net-snmp in November 2000.

SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES

  Please see the FAQ for this information.

  Please let us know if you compile it on other OS versions and it
  works for you so we can add them to the above list.

  Porting:  Please! read the PORTING file.

HELPING OUT

  This is a project worked on by people around the net.  We'd love
  your help, but please read the PORTING file first.  Also, subscribe
  to the net-snmp-coders list described below and mention what you're
  going to work on to make sure no one else is already doing so!
  You'll also need to keep up to date with the latest code snap shot,
  which can be obtained from CVS using the information found at
  http://net-snmp.ucdavis.edu/cvs/?group_id=12694

CODE UPDATE ANNOUNCEMENTS

  See the NEWS file and the ChangeLog file for details on what has
  changed between releases.

  We hate broadcasting announce messages to other mailing lists and
  newsgroups, so there is a mailing list set up to handle release
  announcements.  Any time we put new software out for ftp, we'll mail
  this fact to net-snmp-announce@lists.sourceforge.net.  See the
  MAILING LISTS section described below to sign up for these
  announcements.

  We will post new announcements on a very infrequent basis to the
  other channels (the other snmp mailing lists and newsgroups like
  comp.protocols.snmp), but only for major code revisions and not for
  bug-fix patches or small feature upgrades.

MAILING LISTS

  The lists:

    The following mailing lists have been created for your use:

      net-snmp-announce@lists.sourcerforge.net  -- For announcements
      net-snmp-users@lists.sourcerforge.net     -- For usage discussions
      net-snmp-coders@lists.sourcerforge.net    -- For development discussions
      net-snmp-cvs@lists.sourcerforge.net       -- For cvs update announcements

    To subscribe to these lists, please see:
  
      http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=12694

    The lists you definitely want to subscribe to is the
    net-snmp-announce@lists.sourceforge.net list and the
    net-snmp-users@lists.sourceforge.net list.

AGENT EXTENSIBILITY

  The agent that comes with this package is extensible through use of
  shell scripts and other methods.  See the configuration manual pages
  (like snmpd.conf) and run the snmpconf perl script for further details.

  You can also extend the agent by writing C code directly.  The agent
  is extremely modular in nature and you need only create new files,
  re-run configure and re-compile (or link against its libraries).  No
  modification of the distributed source files are necessary.  See the
  following files for details on how to go about this:
  http://www.netsnmp.org/tutorial/toolkit/, AGENT.txt,
  agent/mibgroup/examples/example.c, and agent/mibgroup/examples/example.h.

  Also, see the local/mib2c program and its README file for help in
  turning a textual mib description into a C code template.

  We now support AgentX for subagent extensibility.  The ucd-snmp
  agent can run as both a master agent and a subagent.  Additionally,
  a toolkit is provided that enables users of it to easily embed a
  agentx client into external applications.  See the tutorial at
  http://ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu/tutorial/toolkit/ for an example of how
  go about doing this.

CONFIGURATION

  See the man/snmp.conf.5 manual page.

  For the agent, additionally see the man/snmpd.conf.5 manual page.

  For the snmptrapd, see the man/snmptrapd.conf.5 manual page.

  You can also run the snmpconf perl script to help you create some of
  these files.

SUBMITTING BUG REPORTS

  Important: *Please* include what version of the ucd-snmp/net-snmp
  package you are using and what architecture(s) you're using, as well
  as detailed information about exactly what is wrong.

  To submit a bug report, please use the web interface at
  http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=12694.  It is a full-fledged
  bug-tracking system that will allow you to search for already
  existing bug reports as well as track the status of your report as
  it is processed by the core developers.

  If you intend to submit a patch as well, please read the PORTING
  file before you do so and then submit it to
  http://sourceforge.net/patch/?group_id=12694.

CLOSING

  We love patches.  Send some to us!  But before you do, please see
  the 'PORTING' file for information on helping us out with the
  process of integrating your patches (regardless of whether its a new
  feature implementation or a new port).

  Also, We're interested if anyone actually uses/likes/hates/whatever
  this package...  Mail us a note and let us know what you think of it!

  Have fun and may it make your life easier,
