NOTE NOTE NOTE: this module depends on a modified version of the
DBD::AnyData module.  The DBD_AnyData.patch file should be applied to version
0.5 of the DBD::AnyData module.  This patch won't be needed in the future when
that modules supports the needed features of the patch.  This is
planned for the future of the DBD::AnyData model, but will probably be
done in a different way.  In other words, *don't* apply this patch to
0.6 or higher of the DBD::AnyData model but instead convince the
author of this module to update to the newer DBD::AnyData API instead.
You'll probably never have to do this.
