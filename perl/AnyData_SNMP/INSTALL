NOTE NOTE NOTE: this module depends on a modified version of the
DBD::AnyData module.  The DBD_AnyData.patch file should be applied to version
0.5 of the DBD::AnyData module.  This patch won't be needed in the future when
that modules supports the needed features of the patch.  This is
planned for the future of the DBD::AnyData model, but will probably be
done in a different way.  In other words, *don't* apply this patch to
0.6 or higher of the DBD::AnyData model but instead convince the
author of this module to update to the newer DBD::AnyData API instead.
You'll probably never have to do this.

*** This is currently alpha level code!!! ***

Jeff Zucker's original (unpatched) AnyData perl modules can be found
at http://www.vpservices.com/jeff/programs/AnyData/ .  However, do not
use the modules from this site as they won't work with the software in
this directory.  (Use the download sites in step 1 below instead.)  It
is a good source for documentation about the AnyData modules.
  

Install steps:
  0) INSTALL the DBI perl module (run: perl -MCPAN -e "install DBI")

  1) download, and install the modified AnyData perl modules from:
     http://www.net-snmp.org/AnyData-wes/AnyData-0.05.tar.gz
     http://www.net-snmp.org/AnyData-wes/DBD-AnyData-0.05.wes.tar.gz
     http://www.net-snmp.org/AnyData-wes/SQL-Statement-0.2001.wes.tar.gz

  2) Extract each of the above tar balls and in the resulting directories
     run:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install   (as root)

  3) Then in this directory, run:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install   (as root)

To use it:
  SQL like Shell script:
    snmpsh [snmpcmd arguments] HOST [SQL COMMAND]

  Example commands to type at the prompt:
    select * from ifTable
    select * from ifTable where ifDescr = 'eth0'
    alias ifconfig select ifDescr, ifAdminStatus where ifDescr = '\1'
    ifconfig eth0
