V3.2
  snmpv2c support.
  split agent/snmp_vars.c in to manageable pieces.
  merge similar apps/* code into one file linked by all apps.
  continue to add and improve manual pages/documentation.
  more snmpset'able variables.
  should be able to set the fix script line in the .conf files per type.

Ideas:
  Make the mib parser figure out which of the above files it needs to
    load rather than loading them all -- Tom Georges & Joe Marzot
