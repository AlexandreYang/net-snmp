TODO list for the ucd-snmp-coders:

  SNMPv2c support.
  Implement the host resources mib as a module.
  make agent/mibgroup/read_config.c create a new macro to allow new
    modules to request callbacks to functions for snmpd.conf lines and
    move to required code rather than a module.
  Merge similar apps/* code into one file linked by all apps.
  Continue to add and improve manual pages/documentation.
  More snmpset'able variables.
  Should be able to set the fix script line in the .conf files per type.
  Run-time configurable access restrictions for mib tree sections.
  Implement IP routing table manipulation using sysctl() on systems that
    support the route socket (BSD 4.4 and IRIX >= 6.2)
  Implement new IP forwarding table MIB (RFC 2096), at least on systems
    that have classless routing tables internally
  Implement IP/UDP/TCP statistics on IRIX 6.2 and later using
    sysmp(MP_SAGET,MPSA_TCPIPSTAT,...) and <sys/tcpipstats.h>
  Follow the evolution of the Interfaces Group MIB
    (draft-ietf-ifmib-mib-05.txt) and implement what can be
    implemented.
  Make read_objid and sprint_objid agree on which shorthands they accept.
  numeric to symbolic trap OID conversion.

Other Ideas:
  Make the mib parser figure out which of the above files it needs to
    load rather than loading them all -- Tom Georges & Joe Marzot
