.SH NAME
snmpd.examples - example configuration for the Net-SNMP agent
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I snmpd.conf(5)
man page defines the syntax and behaviour of the various
configuration directives that can be used to control the
operation of the Net-SNMP agent, and the management information
it provides.
.PP
This companion man page illustrates these directives, showing
some practical examples of how they might be used.
.SH AGENT BEHAVIOUR
.SS "Listening addresses"
The default agent behaviour (listing on the standard SNMP UDP port on
all interfaces) is equivalent to the directive:
.RS
agentaddress udp:161
.RE
or simply
.RS
agentaddress 161
.RE
The agent can be configured to \fIonly\fR accept requests sent to the
local loopback interface (again listening on the SNMP UDP port), using:
.RS
agentaddress localhost:161     \fI# (udp implicit)\fR
.RE
or
.RS
agentaddress 127.0.0.1     \fI# (udp and standard port implicit)\fR
.RE
It can be configured to accept both UDP and TCP requests (over both IPv4
and IPv6), using:
.RS
agentaddress udp:161,tcp:161,udp6:161,tcp6:161
.RE
.\"
.\" Can the agent handle the same port for both IPv4 & IPv6
.\"
Other combinations are also valid.
.SS "Run-time privileges"
The agent can be configured to relinquish any privileged access once it
has opened the initial listening ports.  Given a suitable "snmp" group
(defined in \fI/etc/group\fR), this could be done using the directives:
.RS
.nf
agentuser  nobody
agentgroup snmp
.fi
.RE
A similar effect could be achieved using numeric UID and/or GID values:
.RS
.nf
agentuser  #10
agentgroup #10
.fi
.RE
.\"
.\" What effect will/may this have on the information returned.
.\"   ??? Mention this in the main man page.
.\"
.SS SNMPv3 Configuration
Rather than being generated pseudo-randomly,
the engine ID for the agent could be calculated based on the MAC address
of the second network interface (\fIeth1\fR), using the directives:
.RS
engineIDType 3
engineIDNic  eth1
.RE
or it could be calculated from the (first) IP address, using:
.RS
engineIDType 1
.RE
or it could be specified explicitly, using:
.RS
engineID "XXX - WHAT FORMAT"
.RE
.\"
.\" Does engineID override the other directives, or what?
.\"
.SH ACCESS CONTROL
.SS SNMPv3 Users
The following directives will create three users, all using exactly
the same authentication and encryption settings:
.RS
.nf
createUser me     MD5 "single pass phrase"
createUser myself MD5 "single pass phrase" DES
createUser andI   MD5 "single pass phrase" DES "single pass phrase"
.fi
.RE
Note that this defines three \fIdistinct\fR users, who could be granted
different levels of access.  Changing the passphrase for any one of
these would not affect the other two.
.PP
Separate pass phrases can be specified for authentication and
encryption:
.RS
createUser onering SHA "to rule them all" AES "to bind them"
.RE
Remember that these \fIcreateUser\fR directives should be defined in the
PERSISTENT_DIRECTORY/snmpd.conf file, rather than the usual location.
.RE
.\"
.\"  ??? Illustrate "-e", "-l" and "-m" forms ??
.\"
.SS Traditional Access Control
The SNMPv3 users defined above can be granted access to the full
MIB tree using the directives:
.RS
.nf
rouser me
rwuser onering
.fi
.RE
Or selective access to individual subtrees using:
.RS
.nf
rouser myself   .1.3.6.1.2
rwuser andI     system
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that a combination such as:
.RS
.nf
rouser onering
rwuser onering
.fi
.RE
should \fBnot\fR be used. This would configure the user \fIonering\fR
with read-only access (and ignore the \fIrwuser\fR entry altogether).
.PP
The directives:
.RS
.nf
rocommunity public
rwcommunity private
.fi
.RE
would define the commonly-expected read and write community strings
for SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c requests.  This behaviour is \fBnot\fR
configured by default, and would need to be set up explicitly.
.RS
.IP Note:
It would also be a very good idea to change \fIprivate\fR to something
a little less predictable!
.RE
.PP
A slightly less vulnerable configuration might restrict what information
could be retrieved:
.RS
rocommunity public   default system
.RE
or the management systems that settings could be manipulated from:
.RS
rwcommunity private  10.10.10.0/24
.RE
(or both!)
.SS VACM Configuration
This last pair of settings are equivalent to the full VACM definitions:
.RS
.nf
\fI#         sec.name  source        community\fR
com2sec   public    default       public
com2sec   mynet     10.10.10.0/24 private
com2sec6  mynet     fec0::/64     private

\fI#                  sec.model  sec.name\fR
group  worldGroup  v1         public
group  worldGroup  v2c        public
group  myGroup     v1         mynet
group  myGroup     v2c        mynet

\fI#              incl/excl   subtree     [mask]\fR
view   all     included    .1
view   sysView included    system

\fI#              context model level   prefix  read    write  notify (unused)\fR
access  worldGroup  ""  any  noauth  exact   system  none   none
access  myGroup     ""  any  noauth  exact   all     all    none
.fi
.RE
.PP
There are several points to note in this example:
.PP
The \fIgroup\fR directives have to be repeated for 
both SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c requests.
The \fIcom2sec\fR security name is distinct from the community
string that is mapped to it. They can be the same ("public")
or different ("mynet"/"private") - but what appears in the
\fIgroup\fR directive is the security name, regardless of
the community strings.
.PP
Both of the \fIview\fR directives are defining simple OID
subtrees, so neither of these require an explicit mask field.
In fact, this field is only necessary when defining row slices
across a table (or similar views), and can usually be omitted.
.\"
.\" Mention/use hardwired views	'_all_' and '_none_'
.\"
.\" Illustrate other, more flexible configurations
.\"   including SNMPv3 access.
.\"
.SS Typed-View Configuration
A similar configuration could also be configured as follows:
.RS
.nf
view   sys2View included    system
view   sys2View included    .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1

authcommunity read       public  default      -v sys2View
authcommunity read,write private 10.10.10.0/8
.fi
.RE
.PP
This mechanism allows multi-subtree (or other non-simple) views to
be used with the one-line \fIrocommunity\fR style of configuration.
.PP
It would also support configurin "write-only" access, should this
be required.
.\"
.\" Expand this example
.\"
.SH SYSTEM INFORMATION
.SS System Group
The full contents of the 'system' group (with the exception of \fCsysUpTime\fR)
can be explicitly configured using:
.RS
.nf
\fI# Override 'uname -a' and hardcoded system OID - inherently read-only values\fR
sysDescr     Universal Turing Machine mk I
sysObjectID  .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.3.2.1066

\fI# Override default values from 'configure' - makes these objects read-only\fR

.fi
.RE
.SS Host Resources Group
The list of devices probed for potential inclusion in the
\fChrDiskStorageTable\fR (and \fChrDeviceTable\fR) can be amended using
any of the following directives:
.RS
ignoredisk /dev/rdsk/c0t2d0
.RE
which prevents the device \fI/dev/rdsk/c0t2d0\fR from being scanned,
.RS
.nf
ignoredisk /dev/rdsk/c0t[!6]d0

.fi
.RE
either of which prevents all devices \fI/dev/rdsk/c0t\fRX\fId0\fR
(except .../\fIc0t6d0\fR) from being scanned,
.RS
ignoredisk /dev/rdsk/c1*
.RE
which prevents all devices whose device names start with \fI/dev/rdsk/c1\fR
from being scanned, or
.RS
ignoredisk /dev/rdsk/c?t0d0
.RE
which prevents all devices \fI/dev/rdsk/c\fRX\fIt0d0\fR
(where 'X' is any single character) from being scanned.
.SS Process Monitoring 
The list of services running on a system can be monitored
(and provision made for correcting any problems), using:
.RS
.nf
\fI# At least one web server process must be running at all times\fR
proc    httpd
procfix httpd  /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart

\fI# There should never be more than 10 mail processes running
#    (more implies a probable mail storm, so shut down the mail system)\fR
proc    sendmail   10
procfix sendmail  /etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail stop

\fI# There should be a single network management agent running
#   ("There can be only one")\fR
proc    snmpd    1  1
.fi
.RE
Also see the "DisMan Event MIB" section later on.
.SS Disk Usage Monitoring
The state of disk storage can be monitored using:
.RS
.nf
includeAllDisks 10%
disk /var 20%
disk /usr  3%
\fI#  Keep 100 Mb free for crash dumps\fR
disk /mnt/crash  100000
.fi
.RE
.SS System Load Monitoring

.RS

The following example configuration checks the hrSWRunPerfTable table
(listing running processes) for any process which is consuming > 10Mb
of memory.  It performs this check every 600 seconds (the default).
For every process it finds exceeding the limit, it will end out
exactly one notification.  In addition to the normal hrSWRunPerfMem
oid and value sent in the trap, the hrSWRunName object will also be
sent.  Note that the hrSWRunName object actually occurs in a different
table, but since the indexes to the two tables are the same this works
out alright.

Note that the timeout and retry settings can be asymmetric
for the two directions, and the sub-agent can poll the master agent
at regular intervals (600s = every 10 minutes), to ensure the
connection is still working.
