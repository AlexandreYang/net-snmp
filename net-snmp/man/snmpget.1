.TH SNMPGET 1 "13 July 1994"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
snmpget - communicates with a network entity using SNMP GET Requests.
.SH SYNOPSIS
snmpget [ common arguments ] objectID [objectID]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Snmpget is an SNMP application that uses the GET Request to query for
information on a network entity.  One or more fully qualified object
identifiers may be given as arguments on the command line.
Each variable name is given in the format specified in
.IR variables (5).
.PP
For example
.PP
.I snmpget zeus public system.sysDescr.0
.PP
will retrieve the variable system.sysDescr.0:
.PP
.I system.sysDescr.0 =
"SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m"
.PP
If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an error
packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to pinpoint in what
way the request was malformed.  If there were other variables in the request,
the request will be resent without the bad variable.
.PP
.SH "SEE ALSO"
snmpcmd(1), variables(5).
