    - version update

hardaker  5 Jun 95 12:44:46
    - agent/extensible/Makefile:
        --  no longer requires GNU make
        --  etags no longer run by default
    
    - SunOS additions:
        -- loadaverage checking MIB enabled
        -- disk checking MIB enabled

hardaker  9 Jun 95 10:21:07
    - Added a SNMPBLOCK option to the config.h file.  Supposedily setting
      this to zero (now the default) will allow snmp requests to time out.
      Haven't tested it throughly.

    - Correctly ordered the mib table list.
      --  Need to write a dynamic checker/re-orderer.

hardaker  9 Jun 95 10:23:35
    - Correct usage for snmpwalk is now possible.  IE, snmpwalk target
      .1.3.6.1 will now browse the entire tree.
      -- Still fails on relocatable extensible mibs and will until I
         write a dynamic tree builder.

hardaker  9 Jun 95 14:08:15
    - Changed test -x to test -f in snmplib/Makefile.  Not all OSes
      (ie ultrix) handle this.

hardaker 12 Jun 95 10:35:38
    - local/trapnotif:
      -- uses snmpv2 now (correctly)

hardaker 12 Jun 95 10:37:46
    - Reports all errors through the error mib now instead of through perror().
    - Cleaned up error handling.  Shouldn't handle errors nicely if system
      errors occur when scanning an extensible mib.

    agent:
    - Mib table is now qsorted at run time and the extensible variables are
      sorted in at this time.  This brings the agent up to correct
      SNMPwalk/getnext protocols.  You can now walk the entire tree
      including the extensible sections and it won't stop.
      * This has an added bonus of checking the mib table
        (agent/snmp_vars.c) for correct order.  I have added things to the
        wrong location too many times and caused the agent to function
        incorrectly.  Major win.

    - Cleaned up/Added more documentation to config.h
    - GLOBALSECURITY now uses the left most four bits in the MIB acl.
      This is more compatible with the CMU code than using the left most
      2, which was done previously.

    - Added more documentation to the README file.
    - Created a mailing list to handle announcements
      (ucd-snmp-announce@ece.ucdavis.edu)
