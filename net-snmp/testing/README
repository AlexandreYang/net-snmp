The RUNFULLTESTS script is a wrapper around the tests.  All the
tests are required to produce TAP output (hopefully soon to be
standardized itself).

By default RUNFULLTESTS only executes the tests in fulltests/default.
Use the -g flag to test other subdirectories, or use '-g all' to test
everything it can find.
