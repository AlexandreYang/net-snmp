TODO list for the ucd-snmp-coders:

  snmpv3 support
  possibly add WinSNMP wrappers around the ucd-snmp functions
  Continue to add and improve manual pages/documentation.
  More snmpset'able variables.
  Should be able to set the fix script line in the .conf files per type.
  Implement IP routing table manipulation using sysctl() on systems that
    support the route socket (BSD 4.4 and IRIX >= 6.2)
  Implement new IP forwarding table MIB (RFC 2096), at least on systems
    that have classless routing tables internally
  Implement IP/UDP/TCP statistics on IRIX 6.2 and later using
    sysmp(MP_SAGET,MPSA_TCPIPSTAT,...) and <sys/tcpipstats.h>
  Follow the evolution of the Interfaces Group MIB
    (draft-ietf-ifmib-mib-05.txt) and implement what can be
    implemented.
  Make read_objid and sprint_objid agree on which shorthands they accept.
  snmpset should check against MIB size if possible?

Other Ideas:
  Make the mib parser figure out which of the above files it needs to
    load rather than loading them all -- Tom Georges & Joe Marzot
