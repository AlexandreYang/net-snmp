INTRO

  This package contains a port and modified code of the CMU 2.1.2.1
  snmp agent.  It has been modified to allow extensibility quickly
  and easily.  It is far from the best and most configurable systems;
  but hey: its free.
  
SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES

  It has been know to work on the following architectures:  

     hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.05
       - known to work under 9.03, 9.01
     hppa1.1-hp-hpux10.10
       - known to work under 10.01
     mips-dec-ultrix4.4
       - known to work under 4.2, 4.3
     sparc-sun-solaris2.4
       - known to work under 2.3, 2.5
     sparc-sun-sunos4.1.4

  Please let me know if you compile it on other OS versions and it
  works for you so I can add them to the above list.

  Porting:  Please! read the PORTING file.

AVAILABILITY

  ftp.ece.ucdavis.edu:/pub/snmp/ucd-snmp.README
  ftp.ece.ucdavis.edu:/pub/snmp/ucd-snmp.tar.gz

  This file will always point to the latest revision.  If you see
  newer revisions in the directory marked with a -A[1-9] or -B[1-9]
  please note that these are alpha ports of the next release.  Beware.

INSTALLATION

  See the INSTALL file distributed with this package.

COPYING AND COPYRIGHTS

CODE UPDATE ANNOUNCEMENTS / MAILING LIST(S)

  See the NEWS file and the ChangeLog file for details on what changes
  between releases.

  I hate broadcasting announce messages to other mailing lists and
  newsgroups, so there is a mailing list setup to handle release
  announcements.  Anytime I put new software out for ftp, I'll mail it
  to ucd-snmp-announce@ece.ucdavis.edu.  To subscribe/unsubscribe
  yourself to/from this list, mail a note to
  ucd-snmp-announce-request@ece.ucdavis.edu with a subject line of
  'subscribe' or 'unsubscribe'.  I will post new announcements on a
  very infrequent basis to the other channels (the snmp mailing lists
  and comp.protocols.snmp), but only for major code revisions and not
  for bug-fix patches or small feature upgrades.

  The above mailing list is not a general purpose discussion list.  A
  separate list has been created for that purpose.  To subscribe to
  it, mail a note to ucd-snmp-request@ece.ucdavis.edu with a
  subject line of 'subscribe' or 'unsubscribe'.  To use it, mail to 
  ucd-snmp@ece.ucdavis.edu.

  In addition, there is yet another mailing list called
  ucd-snmp-coders@ece.ucdavis.edu, which is where all bug reports,
  questions and patches should be sent to.  The traffic volume is a
  bit higher and is really only of interest to those who intend to
  work on the code and submit patches frequently.  To join it, mail a
  "subscribe" request to ucd-snmp-coders-request@ece.ucdavis.edu.

EXTENSIBILITY

  The agent that comes with this package is extensible through use of
  shell scripts and other methods.  See the configuration manual pages
  (snmpd.conf) and the EXAMPLE.conf file for details.

  Note:  This agent uses its own API for extensibility.  The IETF's
  agentx working group is working on developing a common API for
  subagent extensibility.  See them for details.

EXAMPLE USAGE 

  See the 'EXAMPLE.conf' file in the top level source directory (you
  must build the package for this file to be generated).  Do NOT look
  at the EXAMPLE.conf.def file.  It will only confuse you.

CONFIGURATION

  See man/snmpd.conf.5 and the EXAMPLE.conf file mentioned above.

SNMPv1 vs. SNMPv2

  Typically, I doubt you want people to look at most of your mib tree.
  By defining GLOBALSECURITY in the config.h file, you can restrict
  access to any of the mibs implemented in this package to the
  security type you define it to.  I define mine to SNMPV2AUTH, or
  authenticated requests only.  I then define the SECURITYEXCEPTIONS
  to allow .100 requests, since HP Openview can only use SNMPv1
  protocols.  The CMU code does not have hooks for privacy protocols,
  so nothing is mentioned about it here.  If you don't understand
  anything I have said here, change GLOBALSECURITY to SNMPV1 and you
  shouldn't have problems.

THANKS

  I've probably forgotten people on this list.  Let me know if you've
  contributed code and I've left you out.

SUBMITTING BUG REPORTS

  Please submit all bug reports and patches to
  ucd-snmp-coders@ece.ucdavis.edu.  *Please* include what version of
  the ucd-snmp package you are using and what architecture(s) you're
  using, as well as detailed information about exactly what is wrong.
  If you intend to submit a patch as well, please read the PORTING
  file before you do so.  Thanks!

CLOSING

  I love patches.   Send some to me!  But before you do, please see
  the 'PORTING' file for information on helping me out with the
  process of integrating your patches.

  Also, We're interested if anyone actually uses/likes/hates/whatever this
  package...  Mail us a note and let us know what you think of it!

  Have fun,

    Wes Hardaker
