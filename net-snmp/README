This package contains a port of the cmu snmp v2.1.2 package for hp-ux
700 series 9.0.5 computers.  No additional changes or modifications
were made other than those changes necissary for porting.  I
personally use a modified version of this code with limited
extensibility supported, which I will release shortly after this
release.

I know it compiles and works, but I haven't tested quiet everything.
If you find something which breaks, you can either fix it and send me
a patch or tell me and I'll attempt to fix it myself.
