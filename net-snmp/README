INTRO

  This package contains a port and modified code of the CMU 2.1.2.1
  snmp agent.  It has been modified to allow extensibility quickly
  and easily.  It is far from the best and most configurable systems;
  but hey: its free.
  
  A while back, we wanted to monitor problems on our network and hosts
  that were easily noticeable.  Therefore, we needed an extensible
  agent.  We started with the agent distributed with Ultrix 4.2, but
  had serious problems with it (there is now way to distinguish
  between get/getnext requests causing the agent to loop forever).
  Then we decided to look into the HP extensible agent.  Looked
  perfect.  Then we saw the price.  Too much for an educational
  facility (it was ~$1000/host but is now closer to $200/host).  

  We opted for the third route: modifying the CMU code to do the
  things we wanted.  This gives the added benefit of being free and
  would be identical on all the architectures we wished to support.
  This package is a result of that effort.

  We use this agent here to monitor known system problems before they
  take the machine over.  The agent can be easily configured to
  monitor the number of a given process running, run external scripts
  to check and report functional status.  Examples: mountd(s) under
  Ultrix 4.3 which tend to fork themselves crazy and eventually fill
  up the process table; On our hp700s, "amd" sometimes stops working,
  HP VUE hangs and fails to start X, etc.

  We use HP-OpenView to poll the enclosed agent every half an hour
  looking for these problems.  The problems are then logged in a file,
  which the programmers monitor using xlbiff.  Additionally, we use
  the perl/tk 'snmpcheck' script found in the local subdirectory to
  automatically check and fix these problems.  I don't know how useful
  this package will be to the outside world, but I thought I'd let you
  decide that for yourself.

SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES

  I'm using it on these architectures:  

     hppa1.1-hp-hpux9.05
        -- I develop here...  Its the architecture best supported in
	   this package.  It is the only architecture that supports
	   swap space checks. 

     mips-dec-ultrix4.3
       - known to work under 4.2, 4.4
     sparc-sun-solaris2.4
       - known to work under 2.3, 2.5
     sparc-sun-sunos4.1.4
       - known to work under 4.1.2, 4.1.3
     alpha-dec-osf3.2

  Please let me know if you compile it on other OS versions and it
  works for you so I can add them to the above list.

  newer revisions in the directory marked with a -A[1-9] or -B[1-9]

INSTALLATION

  See the INSTALL file distributed with this package.

CODE UPDATE ANNOUNCEMENTS / MAILING LIST

  I hate broadcasting announce messages, so there is a mailing list
  setup to handle release announcements.  Anytime I put new software
  out for ftp, I'll mail it to ucd-snmp-announce@ece.ucdavis.edu.  To
  subscribe/unsubscribe yourself to/from this list, mail a note to
  ucd-snmp-announce-request@ece.ucdavis.edu with a subject line of
  'subscribe' or 'unsubscribe'.  I will post new announcements on a
  very infrequent basis to the other channels (the snmp mailing lists
  and comp.protocols.snmp), but only for major code revisions and not
  for patches or small feature upgrades.

EXAMPLE USAGE 

  See the 'EXAMPLE.conf' file in this directory (you must build the
  package for this file to be generated).

CONFIGURATION

  See man/snmpd.conf.5

MISC

  - snmpd now detaches from the shell unless -f (don't fork) is
    specified on the command line.

  - Mib table is now qsorted at run time and the extensible variables are
    sorted in at this time.  This brings the agent up to correct
    SNMPwalk/getnext protocols.  You can now walk the entire tree
    including the extensible sections and it won't stop.

    * This has an added bonus of checking the mib table
      (agent/snmp_vars.c) for correct order.  I have added things to the
      wrong location too many times and caused the agent to function
      incorrectly.  Major win.

SNMPv1 vs. SNMPv2

  Typically, I doubt you want people to look at most of your mib tree.
  By defining GLOBALSECURITY in the config.h file, you can restrict
  access to any of the mibs implemented in this package to the
  security type you define it to.  I define mine to SNMPV2AUTH, or
  authenticated requests only.  I then define the SECURITYEXCEPTIONS
  to allow .100 requests, since HP Openview can only use SNMPv1
  protocols.  The CMU code does not have hooks for privacy protocols,
  so nothing is mentioned about it here.  If you don't understand
  anything I have said here, change GLOBALSECURITY to SNMPV1 and you
  shouldn't have problems.

CLOSING

  Have fun,
  I love patches.   Send some to me!

  Also, I'm interested if anyone actually uses/likes/hates/whatever this
  package...  Mail me a note and let me know what you think of it!
