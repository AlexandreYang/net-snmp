DISCLAIMER

  This is an alpha release because I haven't tested everything yet.  I
  use this software on over 150 hosts to monitor our systems.  Because
  we use HP-OpenView as our manager, I haven't tested snmpv2 at all
  (HP-OV only uses v1).  

  Also, "snmpwalk .1" will not work like it should for my mibs.  I've
  been too lazy to fix this, but its on the top of my list now.

  Don't forget to use different community names for your mibs!  They
  are all set to public in this package!

INTRO

  This package contains a port and modified code of the CMU snmp agent.
  It has been modified to to add extensiblity quickly and easily.  It is
  far from the best and most configurable systems, but hey, its free.
  
  We use this here to monitor known system problems before they take the
  machine over.  A good example is mountd on the dec5000s tend to fork
  themselves crazy and eventually fill up the process table.  On our
  hps, amd sometimes stops working, vue hangs and fails to start X, this
  type of thing.  We use HP-OpenView to poll the enclosed agent every
  half an hour looking for these problems.  The problems are then logged
  in a file, which the programmers monitor using xlbiff.  I don't know
  how useful this package will be to the outside world, but I thought
  I'd let you decide that for yourself.
  
DESIGN

  Each mib that we use has the following conventions:  Under each mib
  in the extensible section, there are a number of tables that are
  built into every mib:

  .1    INDEX -- A unique numeral for each entry
  .2    NAME  -- unique name 
  .100  FLAG  -- In most cases a 1 or a 0 indicating an error.
                 For extensible shell/exec functions, the exit status
		 of the process.
  .101  MESG  -- A message describing the problem or the first line of
                 the output of the shell/exec.
  .102  FIX   -- A setable entry to fix the given problem using a
                 shell script or whatever that knows how to fix things.

  Now, lets take the process check mib (defined in config.h).  Under this
  mib there is the following set of additional mib tables:

  .3    MIN   -- straight from the config file
  .4    MAX   -- ditto
  .5    NUM   -- the actual number found running

  The exec entries that define their own mibs use the standard
  extensions defined above.

SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES

  I'm using it on three architectures:  
     hp700s/hpux9.0.5
        -- I develop here...  Its the architucture best supported in
	   this package.  I haven't implemented everything on the
	   sun/dec architectures.  

     sun4/4.1.4               (note:  NOT SOLARIS) (note: no disk/swap/load)
     Dec5000/Ultrix 4.2                            (note: no swap)

INSTALLATION

  Edit config.h in this directory to taste.  Its fairly well
  documented. 

  make

MAN PAGES/DOCUMENTATION

  Write them for me, would ya?  All you get is this file!

CONFIGURATION

  By default, it looks for two files when it starts up, both of which
  are defined in config.h.  This file contains different types of
  arguments:

--

  proc PROCESSNAME [MAX] [MIN]
  e.g.:  proc ntalkd 4 0

  This checks the process list for PROCESSNAME, and reports an error
  if not found or less than MIN are found or more than MAX are found.

--

  swap SIZE
  e.g.:  swap 16000

  Reports an error if less than SIZE swap space is available.

--

  disk MOUNTLOC SIZE
  e.g.:  disk / 10000

  Generates an error if MOUNTLOC has less than SIZE bytes of space.

--

  load ONE FIVE FIFTEEN
  e.g.:  load 12 14 14
  
  Generates an error if the loadaverage of a machine grows beyond
  these numbers.  Useful if your machine stops receiving mail beyond a
  given load average.

--

  exec [MIB] NAME COMMAND
  shell [MIB] NAME COMMAND
  e.g.:  exec test /bin/sh /script/to/check/something
  e.g.:  exec .1.3.6.4.1000.10 top /usr/local/bin/top

  Execs the script and reports the exit status and one line output for
  the defualt mib specified in config.h.  If a mib is given, it uses
  that location in the mib tree instead and you can snmpwalk the
  output for *all* the lines of output.

  e.g.:  "snmpwalk -v 1 machine public .1.3.6.4.1000.10.101" will get you the
         "top" output from the machine.

--

MISC

  snmpd now detaches from the shell unless -f is specified (don't fork)

  the "local" directory has some scripts I use a lot.  
    -- trapnotif -- called from OV upon detection of an error
    -- snmpcheck -- pre-pre-alpha of a perl5.001/Tkb4 script to fix problems
    -- rsnmp     -- snmpwalks known mibs (so you don't have to
                    remember them)
    -- fixproc   -- the perl script we use to fix things remotely.

CLOSING

Have fun,
I love having patches sent to me!
