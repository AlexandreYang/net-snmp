This directory holds the implementation of individual MIB groups.
Currently, this contains the eight MIB-2 groups, plus a basic template
for new MIB groups (wombat.c and wombat.h)

Each group consists of two files:

  wombat.h:	interface information

	- declaration of the initialisation function 'init_wombat'
	- declaration of the function(s) for retrieving variable
		information 'var_wombat'
	- declaration of the function(s) for setting variable
		information (if appropriate)

	- definitions of the MIB group 'magic numbers'
		declarations of the 'public' funtions

	- a list of the variables in the group, including
		type information, mapping between magic numbers
		and OID sub-identifiers within the group,
		accessibility information, and the relevant
		function for retrieving this variable's value.
	- a 'subtree' definition, identifying the location of
		this MIB group within the general MIB structure.

	(these last two are only visible within the 'glue' file
	 'snmp_vars.c', but are declared here for maintainability)



  wombat.c:	implementation code

	- a list of kernel information needed to report
		on this group
	- an initialisation function (possibly empty)
	- 'header' function(s) to map the OID requested
		to the next appropriate OID
		(and similar system-independant setup)
	- function(s) (possibly system-specific) to
		determine and return the value of the
		variable requested.
	- (optionally) functions used to set values
	- other functions used internally


To implement a new MIB group, copy the two files 'wombat.c'
and 'wombat.h' to approprate new files, and edit them as
follows:

	wombat.h:
		globally change "wombat" to the new group identifier
		    and update the initial comment.
		replace the WOMBAT* defines with the list of
		    variables within this new group
		fill in the 'wombat_variables' structure with these
		    new variables, updating the type, acessibility
		    and sub-identifier information as appropriate.
		replace 'variableN' with the maximum size of the
		    returned OID (omitting the group prefix).
		    For non-table values, this will probably be one
		    greater than the length of the sub-identifier.
		update the SUBTREE definition with the appropriate
		    location within the global MIB structure, and
		    its length (note that 'MIB' has length 6)


	wombat.c:
		globally change "wombat" to the new group identifier
		    and update the initial comment.
		replace the 'wombat_nl' name list with any necessary
		    kernel variables, and update the associated #define's
		replace the name length definition within the 'header'
		    function with the length of the requesting OID
		    (i.e. the sum of the lengths given in the subtree
		     definition, and the variable structure above).
		replace the basic 'switch' structure within the 'var_wombat'
		    function with the necessary code to calculate the
		    required information.
		(plus any other internal functions as needed).

	../snmp_vars.h:
		include the new group header file

	../snmp_vars.c:
		in the function 'init_snmp', add a call to the new
		    initialisation routine.
		in the structure 'subtrees_old', add a reference to
		    the new subtree definition.

	Makefile:
		add the new object file to the compilation list (OBJS).

	../Makefile:
		add the new object file to the link list (MIBOBJS).
