ipfwchains-module
-----------------
This module is still being worked on.
Future enhancements will include :
* adding variables to zero the packet and byte counters
* adding a variable to reorder the firewalling rules on
  the firewall, to increase efficiency
To compile this module into the agent :
copy IPFWCHAINS-MIB.txt into /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs/
./configure --with-mib-modules="ipfwchains/ipfwchains"

to view the tables with snmptable, use a big time-out value, 
or you won't get the complete table.

Any suggestions or bugfixes are always welcome.
