ipSystemStatsTable README
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This readme file describes the code generated by mib2c (using the MIBs
  for Dummies (MFD) configuration file). The code generated was
  generated specifically for the following SNMP table:

     ipSystemStatsTable

  Your code will be called when the snmp agent receives requests for
  the ipSystemStatsTable table.  The agent will start by looking for the right
  row in your existing data to operate on, if one exists.  It does
  this by comparing the index values for each row for the row that it
  is looking for.  The indexes are described in the next segment
  below, and the looping constructs and requirements are further
  below.  You're expected to have data which is unique to each set of
  indexes.

  Configuration Variables
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Some variables used for code generation may be set to affect the code
  generation. You may override these variables by setting them in the
  file default-table-ipSystemStatsTable.m2d, and then re-running mib2c.

    m2c_table_settable (currently '0')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not code is generated to support
    MIB object which have an access of read-write or read-create. The
    default is set based on whether or not the table contains writable
    objects, but can be over-ridden.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_table_settable = 0@


    m2c_table_dependencies (currently '0')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not code is generated to support
    checking dependencies between columns, rows or tables. The default
    is set based on whether or not the table contains writable objects,
    but can be over-ridden.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_table_dependencies = 0@


    m2c_table_row_creation (currently '0')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not code is generated to support
    checking creation of new rows via SNMP. The default is set based on
    whether or not the table contains read-create objects, but can be
    over-ridden.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_table_row_creation = 0@


    m2c_context_reg (currently 'netsnmp_data_list *')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable contains the structure name to typedef for the
    ipSystemStatsTable_registration_ptr.

    During initilization, you will provide a pointer to a structure of
    this type. This pointer is used as a parameter to many functions so
    that you have access to your registration data. The default is a
    netsnmp_data_list pointer, which will allow you to keep multiple
    pointers tagges by a text name. If you have a new or existing structure
    you would rather use, you can redefine this variable.
    

    To avoid regenerating code, you may also change this typedef directly
    in the ipSystemStatsTable.h header.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_context_reg = "struct my_registration_context@


    m2c_data_context (currently 'netsnmp_systemstats_entry')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable contains the structure name to typedef for the
    ipSystemStatsTable_data.

    This typedef is used in the row request context structure for the table,
    ipSystemStatsTable_rowreq_ctx.

    The typedef in the primary table context will be used for the data and
    undo structure types. This structure should contain all the data
    needed for all the columns in the table. The default is 'generated',
    which will cuase a new data strcuture to be generated with data members
    for each column.

    To avoid regenerating code, you may also change this typedef directly
    in the ipSystemStatsTable.h header.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_data_context = "struct my_data_context"@


    m2c_data_allocate (currently '1')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not the data context (see above)
    requires memory to be allocated. The default generated data structure
    does not. If you are using a custom data context which needs to
    allocate memory, override this value and two additional functions
    will be generated:

      ipSystemStatsTable_allocate_data
      ipSystemStatsTable_release_data

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_data_allocate = 1@


    m2c_data_init (currently '0')
    --------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not the data context (see above)
    or any other items you have added to the table context requires
    initialization. The default generated data structure does not. If you
    are using a custom data context or have added items needing initialization
    to the table context, override this value and two additional functions
    will be generated:

      ipSystemStatsTable_rowreq_ctx_init
      ipSystemStatsTable_rowreq_ctx_cleanup

    Syntax: @eval 0 = 1@


    m2c_table_access (currently 'container-cached')
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines which data interface will be use to generate
    code for looking up data for a given index. The default is the
    'unsorted-external' access code, which handles the common case where
    the data for the table is kept external to the agent and is not sorted
    by the MIB indexes.

    Available options can be determined by checking for mib2c configuration
    files that begin with 'mfd-access-*'.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_table_access = "unsorted-external'@

 
    m2c_include_examples (currently '0')
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines whether or not to generate example code. The
    default is to generate example code.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_include_examples = 0@


    m2c_data_transient (currently '2')
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    This variable determines how the generated example code deals with the
    data during data lookup. See the table readme file for details on how
    the current table access method interprets this value. In general,
    a value of 0 indicates persistent data, 1 indicates semi-transient and
    2 indicates transient data.

    Syntax: @eval $m2c_data_transient = 0@


 Index(es) for the ipSystemStatsTable table
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  The index(es) for the ipSystemStatsTable table are:

     ipSystemStatsIPVersion:
        Syntax:      InetVersion
        DataType:    INTEGER
        C-code type: ASN_INTEGER


  You should know how to set all these values from your data context,
  ipSystemStatsTable_data.


************************************************************************
ipSystemStatsTable File Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Several files have been generated to implement the ipSystemStatsTable
  table. We'll go through these files, one by one, explaining each and
  letting you know which you need to edit.


File: ipSystemStatsTable_data_access.[c|h]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The ipSystemStatsTable_data_access file contains the interface to your data in
  it's raw format.  These functions are used to locate the row for a
  particular request.

  Set index context
  -----------------
  TODO : Set MIB index values
  FUNC : ipSystemStatsTable_indexes_set

  
  container-cached summary
  ------------------------
    The container-cached data access code is for cases when you want to
    cache your data in the agent/sub-agent.

    ... to be continued...


  Updating the Index
  ------------------
    TODO : update index for the raw data
    FUNC : ipSystemStatsTable_indexes_set
    WHERE: ipSystemStatsTable_data_access.c

    This is a convenience function for setting the index context from
    the native C data. Where necessary, value mapping should be done.

    This function should update the table index values (found in
    tbl_idx) for the given raw data.




File: ipSystemStatsTable_enums.h
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This file contains macros for mapping enumeration values when the
  enumerated values defined by the MIB do not match the values used
  internally.

  Review this file to see if any values need to be updated.
