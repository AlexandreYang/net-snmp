This sub-group of the UCD agent is a beta implementation of the
AgentX agent extensibility protocol, as described in RFC 2741.

  This is a reasonably full implementation, in as much as it 
supports all the protocol operations described in this document.
The core functionality has received a reasonable amount of exposure,
and is believed to be more or less stable in normal use.   It
is certainly an order of magnitude more useable than the previous
release (4.1.1/2).

  Some of the less frequently used features (index allocation,
range registration, etc), have received less thorough testing,
and may well not be fully functional.   Many of the omissions
of the earlier release (Contexts, use of GetBulk, the AgentX MIB)
are still missing from this version.

  In addition, the implementation is not particularly robust
in the face of pathological events (e.g. abrupt termination
of subagents).  It is inadvisible to rely on the current code
for production-level services or applications.


  To configure AgentX support into the UCD agent, run configure with
the flag --with-mib-module="agentx", and compile the library and agent.
Copy (or link) the 'snmpd' binary (the main master agent) to 'agentxd',
which will run as a subagent.  Alternatively, the '-X' command-line
option will also invoke the agent in an AgentX subagent role.

  See the main project web page for an examples of a simple stand-alone
subagent.  (http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/tutorial/toolkit/)
