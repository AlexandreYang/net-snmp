This sub-group of the UCD agent is a 'mature beta' implementation of
the AgentX agent extensibility protocol, as described in RFC 2741.

  This is a reasonably full implementation, in as much as it 
supports all the protocol operations described in this document.
The core functionality has received a reasonable amount of exposure,
and is believed to be more or less stable in normal use.   It will
now also handle the non-graceful termination of subagents - returning
a 'genErr' error for three successive requests before unregistering
the unresponsive subagent.

  Note that the reverse is not true, and a subagent will not
re-establish contact with a dead and resurrected master.  Similarly,
a subagent will not be able to re-register in place of a defunct
colleague until the master agent has received three requests for
the dead connection (and hence unregistered it).

  Some of the less frequently used features (index allocation,
range registration, etc), have received less thorough testing,
and may well not be fully functional.   Many of the omissions
of the earlier release (Contexts, use of GetBulk, the AgentX MIB)
are still missing from this version.

While the implementation is not yet suitable for mission-critical
production systems, it should prove sufficiently reliable for
general-purpose use.


  To configure AgentX support into the UCD agent, run configure with
the flag --with-mib-module="agentx", and compile the library and agent.
Copy (or link) the 'snmpd' binary (the main master agent) to 'agentxd',
which will run as a subagent.  Alternatively, the '-X' command-line
option will also invoke the agent in an AgentX subagent role.

  See the main project web page for an examples of a simple stand-alone
subagent.  (http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/tutorial/toolkit/)
