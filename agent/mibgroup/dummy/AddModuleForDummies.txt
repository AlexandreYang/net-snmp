Adding SNMP Agent in UC Davis code (v3.3.1) - for DUMMIES:
==========================================================

(NOTE: I have used NetBSD 1.3.
This document is VERY preliminary and is likely to contain several errors.)

1. Follow ALL installation instructions in the UCD release.

2. In this mail there are 3 files included with this document.
    They should be

    DUMMY-MIB.txt
    dummy.c
    dummy.h

3. Put DUMMY-MIB.txt in /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs/

   Put dummy.c in ucd-snmp-3.3.1/agent/mibgroup/
	
   Put dummy.h in ucd-snmp-3.3.1/agent/mibgroup/

4. Now, do 

	'configure --with-mib-modules="dummy" --with-mibs="DUMMY-MIB:SNMPv2-SMI:SNMPv2-TC:SNMPv2-MIB:SNMPv2-MIB:RFC1213-MIB:UCD-SNMP-MIB"

   Watch the output of configure to see that the dummy code is included.

5. Now, do

	make 

   directly under ucd-snmp-3.3.1/

6. Become root and start the agent, for example

	ucd-snmp-3.3.1/agent/snmpd -L

7. Now you are ready to use the management tools and talk to the agent.
   For example:

	ucd-snmp-3.3.1/apps/snmpwalk -v1 localhost public .1.3.6.1.4.1.dynarc

   This should list the parameters in the DUMMY-MIB.txt.

	(Make sure you are runnning the snmpwalk that was built in step 4 and 5.)

8. Now, go on and edit the mib and the code to your liking. The DUMMY-MIB.txt
   is really simple. I will soon need more complicated mibs (with row-create),
   so once I have figured out how the agent should handle that I will add
   it to this dummy guide.
