.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmpvacm
is an SNMP application that can be used to do simple maintenance on a
SNMP agent's View-based Control Module (VACM) table.  You can create
and delete groups of users, MIB views, and the access settings that
they use.
.PP
The SNMPv3 VACM specifications (see RFC2575) defines assorted tables
to control access to the information supplied by the agent.
These
.BR snmpvacm
commands effectively create or delete rows in the appropriate one of
these tables, and match the equivalent configure directives
which are documented in the
.I snmpd.conf(5)
man page.
.PP
A fuller explanation of how these operate can be found in the project FAQ.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Given a pre-existing user
.I dave
(which could be set up using the
.I snmpusm(1)
command),
we could configure full read-write access to the whole OID tree
using the commands:

.PP
snmpvacm -v3 localhost createSec2Group 3 RWGroup dave
.PP
snmpvacm -v3 localhost createView   all .1 .1
.PP
snmpvacm -v3 localhost createAccess  RWGroup 3 1 1 all all none
.IP
This creates a new security group named "RWGroup" containing the SNMPv3 user "dave",
a new view "all" containing the full OID tree based on
.I .iso(1)
, and then allows those users in the group "RWGroup" (i.e. "dave")
both read- and write-access to the view "all" (i.e. the full OID tree)
when using authenticated SNMPv3 requests.

.IP
As a second example,
we could set up read-only access to a portion
of the OID tree using the commands:

.PP
snmpvacm -v3 localhost createSec2Group 3 ROGroup wes
.PP
snmpvacm -v3 localhost createView   sysView  system system
.PP
snmpvacm -v3 localhost createAccess  ROGroup 3 0 1 system none none
.IP
This creates a new security group named "ROGroup" containing the (pre-existing)
user "wes", a new view "sysView" containing just the OID tree based on
.I .iso(1).org(3).dod(6).inet(1).mgmt(2).mib-2(1).system(1)
, and then allows those users in the group "ROGroup" (i.e. "wes")
read-acces, but not write-access to the view "sysView" (i.e. the system group).

.SH "LIMITATIONS"

This utility does not support the configuration of new community strings,
so is only of use for setting up new access control for SNMPv3 requests.
It can be used to amend the access settings for existing community strings,
but not to set up new ones.

.PP
The use of numeric
.B createAccess
parameters is less than convenient.
These commands do not provide the full flexibility of the
equivalent config file directives.

.PP
There is (currently) no equivalent to the one-shot
configure directives
.I rouser
and
.I rwuser.
