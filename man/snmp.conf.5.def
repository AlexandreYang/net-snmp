.SH NAME
DATADIR/snmp/snmp.conf - configuration file for the ucd-snmp applications.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmp.conf
is the configuration file which define how the ucd-snmp SNMP
applications operate.  Tokens that can be put in them are described in
the
.B DIRECTIVES
section below.
.SH PLEASE READ FIRST
First, make sure you have read the snmp_config(5) manual page that
describes how the ucd-snmp configuration files operate, where they
are located and how they all work together.
.SH DIRECTIVES
.IP "mibdirs (mib-dirs|+mib-dirs)"
Look for textual mibs to parse in the list of ':' separated
directories.  If the directive value starts with a '+' it prepends
this list to the front of the default directory list compiled into the
application.  Note that this value can be overridden by the
.B MIBDIRS
environment variable.
.IP "mibs (mib-tokens|+mib-tokens)"
Specifies a ':' separated list of mib tokens that represent textual
mib files that should be found and parsed.  If the directive value
starts with a '+' it prepends this list to the front of the default
mib token list compiled into the application.  The special keyword of
"ALL" forces all mibs files found to be read. Note that the value
specified here can be overridden by the
.B MIBS
environment variable.
.IP "mibfile file"
Specifies a textual mib file to read and parse, in addition to the
list read from the mibs token.  Note that the value
specified here can be overridden by the
.B MIBFILES
environment variable.
