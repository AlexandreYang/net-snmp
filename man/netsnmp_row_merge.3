.SH "DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
This helper splits a whole bunch of requests into chunks based on the row index that they refer to, and passes all requests for a given row to the lower handlers.
.PP
This is useful for handlers that don't want to process multiple rows at the same time, but are happy to iterate through the request list for a single row.
