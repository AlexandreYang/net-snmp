.SH NAME
snmpd.internal - internal configuration of the Net-SNMP agent
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I snmpd.conf(5)
man page defines the syntax and behaviour of the main
configuration directives that can be used to control the
operation of the Net-SNMP agent, and the management information
it provides.
.PP
However there are several other configuration directives
(many of which, though not all, start with a leading underscore)
that are recognised by the agent.  These are typically used
to retain configuration across agent restarts, and are not
intended for direct user access.
This man page list these directives, giving a brief indication
of where they are used.  For full details - see the relevant source
files.  If you can't follow that source, you probably shouldn't
be fiddling with these directives!
