*3.0.5*

  Bug fixes:

      some mibs were not defined for usage.

  Misc:
    - Updated configure to autoconf 2.7

*3.0.4*

  Mainly a bug fix release:
    - fixed another 32/64 bit problem:  returned exit codes on alphas
      were incorrect.
    - many system errors (e.g., no mem) were causing the agent to
      return error flags when it really was clueless.  
    - found a memory leak in the CMU routing table implementation.
    - More configure cleanups, mostly for Solaris.
    - snmp_open calls getservbyname only once now, at the request of Gary
      Hayward <gah@dirac.bellcore.com>.  Mainly for Perl users.

  New example file:  EXAMPLE.conf file (created at build time).

  local/snmpcheck has drastically improved, and now requires Tk-b8.

  You can now mung with all sorts of numbers in config.h and the
  mib.txt file will be mostly built from it if you change my defaults.

*3.0.3*

  *** default location for .conf and mib.txt files moved to
      .configure's --prefix location

  Now using GNU's auto-conf for better portability
    - prompts for important config.h information as well
